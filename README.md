# HexCryptors
HexCryptors is a bundle of a __Hex__ Encryptor and Decryptor. What does that mean?
## Encryption
Encryption means to take plaintext (Normal, human readable text), and turn it into garble like this:
```48656c6c6f``` (This is hello)
It's.... definitely weird looking, and VERY unreadable.
## Decryption
Decryption means to take the garble that encryption makes, and turns it into plaintext (Human readable, normal text).
Example:
```48656c6c6f becomes Hello```
Anyway, continuing, to open __HexEncryptor.exe__ or __HexDecryptor.exe__ (Sorry, only windows release right now, will update soon for others!)
select the one you want to use. It should be named _HexDecrypter_ or _HexEncryptor_ dependant on which one you want / need to use. Open the exe to start the terminal, and to compile text to hex. Have Fun! (Sorry I spelled Cryptors incorrectly so many times.... It's there in the files. You can change it if wanted.)
