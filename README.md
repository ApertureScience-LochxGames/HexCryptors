# HexCryptors
HexCryptors is a bundle of a `Hex` Encryptor and Decryptor. What does that mean?
## Encryption
Encryption means to take plaintext (Normal, human readable text), and turn it into garble like this:
```48656c6c6f``` (This is hello)
It's.... definitely weird looking, and VERY unreadable.
## Decryption
Decryption means to take the garble that encryption makes, and turns it into plaintext (Human readable, normal text).
Example:
```48656c6c6f becomes Hello```
Anyway, continuing, to open __HexEncryptor.exe__ or __HexDecryptor.exe__ (Sorry, only windows release right now, will update soon for others!)
open the dist folder, and select the one you want to use. Open the exe to start the terminal, and to compile text to hex. Have Fun!
